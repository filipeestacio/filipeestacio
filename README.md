# Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

## Who I am
My name is Filipe (he/him).

I'm not your "traditional" software developer. I started out in 2008 as a civil engineer. In 2017 I was assigned the task of maintaining and extending an Oracle Service Cloud system within my workplace. I had to crash-learn Javascript (and avoided PHP in any way I could).

Some time later I was quitting my job. Programming was just so much fun and I wanted to do that.

## Currently looking for
I am currently looking for an opportunity to work full time in software development. While my skill level is arguably "junior", I am a very fast learner and have extensive experience in various technical and managerial roles within large companies. 

I am also looking for freelance work in a consulting capacity. See "What I do" below and contact me to arrange a chat!

## What I do
A bit of everything, really. Jack Of All Trades if you will. The background in [Civil Engineering helps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineering). Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment. The digital environment has evolved to the point where it has strong parallels.

I use my experience as a civil engineer to see the big picture. I map your current situation, propose a solution and work towards implementing it. I break down this process into three stages.

### Think
I use [Enterprise Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_architecture) principles to analyse, design and plan a strategy for your business and guide through the changes necessary to execute this strategy.

### Try
Most if not all solutions require an investment of some sort (financial or otherwise). To reduce the risk to your business I develop proofs of concept and low cost experiments to validate assumptions.

### Do
When a solution is validated and a decision is made to progress with a full scale implementation, I work with relevant professionals as a "Product Owner" to ensure your business needs are fully met.

## Currently working on

### Beyond Traditional Education
During the Covid-19 Pandemic, most teaching institutions in the world have been forced to move to remote lessons. Due to the urgent nature of this change, schools opted to "lift and shift" their offline methods to online, mostly by having teachers delivering live lectures through video conference. The drawbacks from this approach has had a significant impact on the wellbeing of both their students and the teaching staff and the results were lacking. This is not to say that the experiment has failed. Rather it has revealed the need to re-think education to move from a teacher-centered approach to one that is truly student-centered. My approach involves a hybrid method, leveraging asynchronous lecture delivery and establishing partnerships with local libraries and study-support businesses to house the overflow of students caused by the social distancing rules. The data generated from the student's online activities can be harnessed to help teachers and support staff target the gaps where needed and brings parents closer to their children's progress without requiring a heavy time committment.
